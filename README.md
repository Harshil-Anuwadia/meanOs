<p>The first decentralized, artificially intelligent, MEAN.js stack, operating system. Mean OS is the only operating system hosted anonymous using a P2P network and a suite of non-standard in-browser delivery mechanisms. Mean OS is specifically designed to support both Brave and Tor but is compatible with all other major browsers. Mean OS is Proud to be a BRAVE and TOR supporter, be free!!</p>
 
 Any use of decentralization is a solution to the issues that are caused by centralized systems. Decentralization in government, which is the topic that has received the most attention, has been seen as a solution to problems such as economic decline, the inability of the government to fund services and their general decline in performance of overloaded services, the demands of minorities for a greater say in local governance, the general weakening of the legitimacy of the public sector, and global and international pressure on countries with inefficient, undemocratic, and overly centralized systems. 
 
 In many different studies of decentralization, the following four aims or purposes are usually described as being important. A blockchain-based hosting service is frequently referred to as decentralized hosting. This is due to the fact that blockchain-based hosting is not maintained by a single corporate or third-party organization. Hosting from peer to peer, as opposed to hosting from client to server, is the primary focus of this particular platform. The software that makes up an operating system is designed to function on a networked collection of computer nodes that are autonomous, communicative, and physically separate from one another. They are responsible for ensuring the completion of activities that are being worked on simultaneously by a very large number of CPUs. 
 
 Each component of the global aggregate operating system is kept separately while the full system is preserved on the storage device that is associated with each node. Every one of these subsets is the product of a joint effort on the part of two different service providers. The first type is the ubiquitous minimal kernel, which also goes by the name microkernel and has direct control over a node's hardware. This sort of kernel is often used in embedded systems. This variety will account for the vast majority of the kernels that are produced. A broad collection of system management components come together to form the subnode, which is sometimes referred to as the second half of a node. The coordination of the individual and collective functions of the node is the responsibility of these management components of the system. These components are designed to support user applications while concealing the functionality of the underlying microkernel.

</p>
 
It is generally agreed that HostCoin was the first decentralized hosting service to be built on blockchain technology. It intends to do this by using hosting that is based on blockchain technology. The microkernel and a collection of management components collaborate in order to effectively carry out their individual but interconnected roles in the system. They provide a contribution to the overall purpose of the system, which is to integrate a wide range of resources and processing methods into a system that is dependable and effective. This is the end aim that the system was created to achieve, and it is something to which they have contributed.
 
The term "transparency," which can also be referred to as "single system picture," describes the illusion that is created for users in which the entire system appears to be a single processing unit. This illusion is produced as a result of the ability of the system to persuade humans that the global system is composed of a single processing unit. The incorporation of separate nodes into a larger network creates the impression of a single continuous connection. According to Katherine Brown, the founder and chief marketing officer of Spyic, blockchain-based hosting is a method of data storage that makes it difficult, if not impossible, to change, hack, or defraud the system. Brown referred to blockchain-based hosting as a form of data storage when he made his statement. 
 
 It is a digital record of transactions that have been duplicated and distributed throughout the whole blockchain network of computers. This record is kept in chronological order. A record of each new transaction that takes place on the blockchain is recorded to the ledgers of each participant as soon as the transaction is completed. Any use of decentralization is a solution to the issues that are caused by centralized systems. Decentralization in government, which is the topic that has received the most attention, has been seen as a solution to problems such as economic decline, the inability of the government to fund services and their general decline in performance of overloaded services, the demands of minorities for a greater say in local governance, the general weakening of the legitimacy of the public sector, and global and international pressure on countries with inefficient, undemocratic, and overly centralized systems.

A - [ServiceWorker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) is used as a way to persist the censorship circumvention library after the initial visit to the participating website.

Service workers essentially act as proxy servers that sit between web applications, the browser, and the network (when available). They are intended, among other things, to enable the creation of effective offline experiences, intercept network requests and take appropriate action based on whether the network is available, and update assets residing on the server. They will also allow access to push notifications and background sync APIs.

After the ServiceWorker is downloaded and activated, it handles all `fetch()` events by first trying to use the regular HTTPS request to the original website. If that fails (for whatever reason, be it timeout, or a `4xx`/`5xx` error), the plugins kick-in, attempting to fetch the content via any means are available.

A service worker is an event-driven worker registered against an origin and a path. It takes the form of a JavaScript file that can control the web-page/site that it is associated with, intercepting and modifying navigation and resource requests, and caching resources in a very granular fashion to give you complete control over how your app behaves in certain situations (the most obvious one being when the network is not available).

A service worker is run in a worker context: it therefore has no DOM access, and runs on a different thread to the main JavaScript that powers your app, so it is non-blocking. It is designed to be fully async; as a consequence, APIs such as synchronous XHR and localStorage can't be used inside a service worker.

Service workers only run over HTTPS, for security reasons. Having modified network requests, wide open to man in the middle attacks would be really bad. In Firefox, Service Worker APIs are also hidden and cannot be used when the user is in private browsing mode.

<p>Neocities has collaborated with Protocol Labs to become the first major site to implement IPFS in production. Starting today, all Neocities web sites are available for viewing, archiving, and hosting by any IPFS node in the world. When another IPFS node chooses to host a site from Neocities, that version of the site will continue to be available, even if Neocities shuts down or stops hosting it. The more IPFS nodes seed Neocities sites, the more available (and redundant) Neocities sites become. And the less centrally dependent the sites are on us to continue existing.</p>
